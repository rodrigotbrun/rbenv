# .rbdev env

This is my dev env settings, that includes my daily basis tools, aliases and
functions.

This is focused on my mac env.

This is always a work in progress!.

## Update env

1. Pull the git repo changes
2. Give exec permissions to the _update.sh_ script if you haven't yet `chown +x
~/.rbenv/update.sh`
3. Run `bash ~/.rbdev/update.sh`

This will run my update scripts, usually only will run the stow symlinks again
(in case anything new appears), otherwise, no need to run this update script.
